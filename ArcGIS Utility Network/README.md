# ArcGIS: Utility Network Automation

## Background:
 Python examples/scripts that can aid in working with utility networks for electric distribution in ArcGIS Pro. You can modify and expand upon them to suit your specific requirements and workflows. These scripts demonstrate basic functionalities such as creating diagrams, performing traces, calculating subnetworks, and generating reports in an electric utility network.
 
## 1) Script to Create a Utility Network Diagram:
Explanation: This script creates a utility network diagram for the specified electric utility network. It uses the CreateUtilityNetworkDiagram_management function provided by ArcPy to generate the diagram. The diagram will visualize the network topology and connectivity.

## 2) Script to Perform a Trace on the Utility Network:
Explanation: This script performs a trace operation on the electric utility network starting from specified points (e.g., poles). It traces downstream from the starting points and returns the result. The TraceGeometricNetwork_management function is used for tracing.

## 3) Script to Calculate Subnetworks in the Utility Network:
Explanation: This script calculates default subnetworks within the electric utility network. Subnetworks are groups of connected features within the network. The CalculateDefaultSubnetworks_management function is used to perform this calculation.

## 4) Script to Generate Reports for the Utility Network:
Explanation: This script generates a report for the electric utility network, providing information such as network statistics, errors, warnings, etc. The GenerateUtilityNetworkReport_management function is used to generate the report.
