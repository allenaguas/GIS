QGIS Lat & Long Calculator

Script was created to calculates distances between two locations via lat and long (more points can be configured if needed). The calculator needs the user to input lat and long coordinates to get a more accurate depiction of nautical miles traveled (output can be configured to KM or Miles). This tool was created as a method for aerial operators to calculate the distance allowed to travel before fuel is needed.
