QGIS Lat & Long Calculator

Script was created to calculate distances between two locations via lat and long (more points can be configured if needed). Output is set to display kilometers, meters, miles and nautical miles. 

This script was initially created as a method for aerial operators to calculate the nautical miles allowed to travel before fuel is needed.
