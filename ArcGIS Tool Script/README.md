ArcGIS: Tool Script

Background:
Our company had an influx of new ArcGIS users (little to no GIS experience) which resulted a need to train all individuals on how to use the interface to produce maps of the area of interest they wanted. The amount of time to train these individals has resulted in a loss of productivity and deffered other important tasks.
 

The Solution:
The Tool Script allows users with little to no expericence to select the area they want printed by simplifiying the steps needed for the user.

How to set up script tool:
1) Right click Toolboxes in Catalog and create "New Toolbox(.atbx)" (Skip this step if you already have a .atbx toolbox you already want to use)
