ArcGIS: Tool Script

Background:
Our company had an influx of new ArcGIS users (little to no GIS experience) which resulted a need to train all individuals on how to use the interface and how to produce maps of the area of interest they wanted. The amount of time to train and have the new users study our manuals was resuling in a substatial amount of wasted time
 

The Solution:
The Tool Script allows users with little to no expericence select the area they want printed by simpling only selecting the area and output

How does the script tool work?
1) User needs to select location (area of interest) manually before running script. "Select by Attribute": Once interest of area is selected, the script will select all records that you do NOT want and do an inverse selection. Esentaially selecting all the other areas you wish to proceed with.

2) "Copy Features": Selected features will be copied to new layer

3) Last process is printing the map series into a PDF
